    Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications.
     It involves a variety of tasks, including designing the layout and user interface, writing code,
      and ensuring the site functions smoothly across different devices and browsers. Key technologies in web 
      development include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development, and languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby for back-end development. 
      Effective web development combines both aesthetic design and technical expertise to provide users with an engaging and seamless 
      online experience.

                  Web design is the art and science of creating the visual layout and user experience of a website.
                   It involves planning and building the structure of a website, including its colors, fonts, graphics,
                    and overall style. Good web design ensures that a site is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and 
                    responsive across different devices. Key aspects include understanding user behavior, creating intuitive 
                    navigation, and optimizing the site for both aesthetics and functionality. 
                  The goal of web design is to create an engaging and efficient online presence that meets the needs of 
                  both the business and its users.
